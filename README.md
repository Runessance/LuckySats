## LuckySats: A Non-Custodial, On-Chain Casino Demonstration Platform

LuckySats is a demonstration of a fully on-chain, non-custodial casino platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP) with direct Bitcoin integration via ckBTC. It shows how smart contracts and cryptographic guarantees enable trust-minimized gamblingâ€”using a Plinko game as a practical example.

Users place BTC-denominated wagers through ICP canisters, which manage randomness, payout logic, and bet resolution entirely on-chain. By removing traditional intermediaries, LuckySats illustrates a new standard of fairness, transparency, and decentralization for online betting, where every outcome is verifiably governed by on-chain logic.
